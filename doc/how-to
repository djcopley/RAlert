I mean it's pretty straight forward.

1. Configure radio numbers for the arduinos and configure serial options for the daemon
2. Flash the receiver sketch to the receiver
3. Flash the detector sketch to the detectors
5. Run the daemon on your host computer
6. Stay one step ahead of Resident Assistants

That's about it! Enjoy!
