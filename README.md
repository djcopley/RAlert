# RaLert!
Have you been rolled by your RA? Had your awesome dorm party ruined by someone in a university polo?
Those days are now behind you with the invention of RaLert! RaLert is a revolutionary program for monitoring hall 
traffic and automatically halting the music as soon as movement is detected. Keep tabs on hall traffic and never get 
rolled again!
